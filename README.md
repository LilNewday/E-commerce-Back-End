# E-commerce Back End

## Description

I needed a good functioning database with the capabilty of being able to view, create, place, and delete all of the submissions in it. This was a nice change of pace from my previous work and I enjoyed working within the models. I got a better feel for them and I was glad to have experienced the struggle with the routes as well. Database functionality was the goal of this project and while basic it does what it should well.


## Installation

Run `npm install`. Afterwards source the schema from the database folder in mysql and then run `npm seed` from the seeds folder. Then run `npm start` and your all set.

## Usage

Using insomnia you can GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE files in the code.
